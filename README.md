#Sublime Yii Booster Snippets

_A work in progress._

Type the snippet shortcode and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to complete the snippet.
The '$1' indicates the
position of the caret/s. Some snippets have been set up so that pressing Tab
jumps the caret/s to the next predefined spot. It's a little hard to explain,
but any snippet that has a $1/$2/$3/etc. uses this technique.


Feel free to play with, alter, expand, or ruin these snippets as you please. I
only ask that if you come up with an incredibly handy snippet, or simply one
that I have missed, that you let me know (via email, Twitter or GitHub) so that
I can improve these for everybody. Thanks!

If you find error or think that some snippets would be better without php tags or etc.., send me a github message.
